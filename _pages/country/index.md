  <p>Your first taste of iconic Cotswolds charm is a good one. Castle Combe is up there as one of the prettiest villages in the country, a medieval wonder where golden-stone cottages fill narrow lanes, backdropped at every turn by rolling green hills. Go for a stroll around this picturesque spot and consider popping into the local tea shop for a feast of homemade cakes and savoury treats. Photo ops are a-plenty, but there’s plenty more along the trip, so strap yourself in and make for your next destination.</p>
  <p>Head north through small hamlets and gently-rolling hills, taking in the gorgeous countryside in your stride. Head for the A46 and follow it towards Stroud, covering the southern reaches of the Cotswolds as the road ambles through fields and forgotten farmsteads. Once in Stroud, treat yourself to some local gems at a host of indie shops, from antique finds to handmade keepsakes. There’s an artsy feel to the city, a bohemian undercurrent. On Sundays, the market town lives up to that designation with the farmer’s market, a perfect place to pick up some tasty Cotswolds produce perfect for a picnic stop.</p>

  <p>Once you’ve had your fill of the town, time to escape into the charming beauty of the Cotswolds once more. Take the A419 as it chases the river valley, twisting and turning through the landscape. At its end, you’ll hit Cirencester. Woefully overlooked for glamorous Cheltenham, Cirencester remains a true hidden gem that retains a quaint Cotswold market-town feel. From antiques to lively pubs, market days on Monday and Friday and boutique shopping interspersed with chic deli’s, Cirencester is beautifully historic and vibrant. Follow the B4425 out of town, a road with sweeping bends and lengthy straights, passing through typical hamlets and pretty countryside. Next up is Bibury.</p>
  <p>Bibury’s honey-hued beauty is a sight to behold; it doesn’t get as quaintly English as this. William Morris, pioneer of the Arts &amp; Crafts Movement, went as far as to say it was England’s most beautiful village. It’s hero piece has to be Arlington Row. This small row of weaver’s cottages, first built in 1380, is one of the most iconic images of the region. An obligatory photo stop later, leave this quintessential Cotswold beauty spot and chase the country lanes for more local charm.</p>

  <p>Bourton-on-the-water is another icon of the area. Having stuck to the often single-track, hedge-rowed lanes that are so emblematic of English countryside drives, Bourton offers welcome respite. The small village sits on a stream that is the focal point of the place, with the familiar crooked stone cottages, long greens and car-free walkways mirrored on either side of the water. Small, often medieval footbridges cross the stream, lending to the moniker little Venice. It’s an unfair comparison; Bourton-on-the-water has a rather unique character all of its own, filled with tea shops, pubs and craft shops perfect for whiling away the afternoon. If you haven’t had enough motoring yet, check out the Motor Museum, filled with curios and vintage cool.</p>
  <p>A little further north lie the two Slaughters, Upper and Lower. They too are typical of the area, another pair of perfectly-preserved Cotswold villages. The road northwest cuts through rolling hills, carving through the picturesque fields. It may not be a mountain pass, but there’s a certain laidback charm to this kind of driving. Leave the B407 and follow signs to Winchcombe. The village is worth a stop, with farm shops and delis ready to resupply your trip with divine local flavours. Just outside the village, you’ll find Sudeley Castle.</p>

  <p>This stunning Tudor pile has hosted some of England’s most important characters. From Richard III to Anne Boleyn, its stunning Tudor design evokes riches rather fitting to this picturesque landscape. The gardens, in typical Tudor style, are beautifully landscaped, foreshadowing the regal rooms you can explore on your visit. One of Henry VIII’s wives, Katherine Parr, spent her later days here, and is buried in the pretty 15th century chapel in the grounds.</p>
  <p>Back to the country lanes for a decidedly stately drive to the north of the Cotswolds. Broadway Tower looms over the landscape with a distinctly gothic presence. A folly which William Morris, among others, fell for, a heady climb to the top offers stunning panoramic views that stretch over 16 counties.</p>
  <p>As a final hoorah, head north once more and finish your road trip at the gorgeous Chipping Campden. Another medieval market town of honey-hued cottages, expect that typical Cotswold charm that makes the region so uniquely alluring. Don’t miss the picture-perfect thatched homes dotted around town, and the medieval covered market on the main high street before you hole yourself away in a cosy pub to properly round off your Cotswolds getaway.</p>
