    <h3 class="title title--sm">The Journey</h3>
    <p>We set off from London for a short motorway blast to the Cotswolds. It’s remarkable how little you need to travel to arrive somewhere as beautiful as this place; in just over an hour, my friend and I were chasing the hedge-rowed country lanes in search of our manor stay. Our arrival at Whatley Manor was nothing short of breathtaking. As you drive up the tree-lined private lane, the classic stylings of the house come into view; the experience made us both feel rather posh.</p>
    <p>After dumping our stuff in the room (which had us totally bowled over – it had recently been refurbished, now with a subtle contemporary edge that complemented gorgeous traditional features) we were itching to explore the vast grounds.</p>

    <h3 class="title title--sm">The Manor</h3>
    <p>The immaculate gardens provide endless areas for quiet contemplation – particularly the loggia garden with its swing chairs overlooking a striking water sculpture by a local artist. The remaining 11 gardens were a mixture of tropical flowers and quintessential English courtyards – my favourite was a rose garden with two corner buildings set in stone dedicated to relaxation - small tranquil havens with seating, books and a “press for service” bell.</p>
    <p>Back in the manor, having just 23 rooms makes for an extremely generous plot, with lots of space to play with; there are small touches all over the place – a stunning (fully functioning) antique chess corner, wellies and blankets, dog treats, bicycles (all free to use) all come together to make you feel truly at home… If your home was set within a whopping 12 acres of stunning countryside. Even the walk to the spa is an experience, a long corridor with artwork and scents that give the feeling you’re floating in. It’s an ample spa even without the bookable treatments – hot stone beds, hydrotherapy pool, sauna and much more.</p>

    <h3 class="title title--sm">The Dining</h3>
    <p>As the sun began to set our dining experience began, with an aperitif on the terrace outside the drawing room. It was next to the lily ponds, so we had the lovely sound of a mini waterfall accompanying our cocktail at the beginning of our multi-course adventure. From there we were taken into the main kitchen, where we were served three small dishes by three separate chefs and got a behind-the-scenes sneak peek at what it takes to run a <span class='no-break'>MICHELIN-Starred</span> kitchen. Apparently they’ve been known to allow guests to get right in there and help cook! After this we were seated for the remaining courses, each individual enough to be a signature dish on its own. With a Japanese slant to the menu the chef played with yuzu, lobster, Wagyu beef and black tortellini. Attention to detail was everything; even butter had been turned into a lavish sculpture.</p>
    <p>Almost more impressive than the food itself was the waiting staff’s storytelling behind every ingredient, from where it was sourced to the reasoning behind why it was present in each dish. It could take them the best part of three minutes explaining each course – it sounded magical each time.</p>
    <p>You feel every bit of the five-star service; at no point did we need to ask for anything – staff appeared and disappeared as if by magic and were friendly and quick-witted in every brief encounter. We felt truly pampered.</p>
    <p>I want to live there.</p>
