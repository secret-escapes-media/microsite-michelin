  <p>Inverness will be your gateway to the Highlands. Sat on the river Ness, it’s a picturesque starting point with a burgeoning dining scene, a grand red-stone castle, Victorian marketplace and cosmopolitan atmosphere to soak up. The bloody battlefield of Culloden lies nearby, should you need a reminder of the brutality that the Highlands have seen. Time to head into the wilderness.</p>
  <p>Follow the A82 along the shores of famed Loch Ness. the views along the road are nothing short of spectacular, with the shimmering waters on one side and the rising crags on the other. The romantic ruin of Urquhart Castle is a worthy stop for a picnic, jutting out into the loch with glorious panorama to boot. For a rather less sophisticated outing, the Nessieland museum in Drumnadrochit is riddled with kitsch Nessie paraphernalia – maybe just dip your toe in the gift shop for some tat. Back on the A82, the typical Highland surroundings that wind along Loch Ness make for compelling driving.</p>

  <p>Leave the shores of the loch and aim for Fort William. The fells and tors begin to rise even higher, as Britain’s highest mountain – the imposing Ben Nevis – crops into view. Fort William is the gateway to the surrounding outdoor wonderland. Whether you’re tough enough to tackle the slopes of Ben Nevis, or you’re ready to embark on inspired hikes through loch and mountain landscapes, this is the place to park up and explore the wilderness. </p>
  <p>Leave Fort William on the A830 – the road to the isles. It’s a truly spectacular road that winds through this dramatic Highland landscape. There’s little traffic here and the twists and turns are a joy – the scenery changes from towering mountains to lochs and beaches, offering diverse backdrops to your drive. Nearly halfway to Mallaig, Glenfinnan waits at the mouth of the Loch Shiel. It extends into the horizon, framed by mountains that rise from the shores on either side. Soak up the view, then follow the small river Finnan to reach the Glenfinnan Viaduct. The viaduct is famous, featured in Harry Potter numerous times, making for a rather impressive scene – the walking trail from the train station is the best way to reach it.</p>

  <p>Rejoin the A830 for one last push towards the coast before you reach Mallaig. It’s a pretty harbour town with a steam railway that tails back to the viaduct. A ferry will take you across to the Isle of Skye, one of Scotland’s famous beauty spots. </p>
  <p>Skye is renowned for its compelling landscape, within which you’ll find a host of cosy pubs, sleepy villages and fine restaurants. The roads wind past highland and coastline, in a landscape whose past witnessed great clan rivalries and clashes. Don’t miss beguiling natural features like the Quiraing and The Storr – whose spires paint a mysterious scar on the setting – interwoven with medieval castles and pretty villages. Once you’ve tackled the best of walks and the finest of drives, leave the isle via the eponymous bridge and follow the coastline north.</p>

  <p>Heading for Applecross, the Bealach na Bà awaits; A big sign warns of the perils you’ll face on this snaking mountain pass. It’s gradient climbs dramatically, with snake-like hairpins and turns that traverse a path of unforgettable panorama over Skye. It’s one of the of the finest roads in Britain. Take a moment’s respite in Applecross. This seaside retreat, remote and – as you are by now aware – a challenge to get to, provides a warm welcome to those that have braved the Bealach na Bà. Looking out across the waters as you sit in front of the Applecross Inn, soaking up the glorious scene with a pint of local ale.</p>
  <p>North along the coastal roads leads to the imposing Beinn Eighe. This towering crag rises on one side of Loch Maree, striking a powerful pose. A trail leads from the car park through the ancient forest and to the base of the rocky mountain. A scramble to the top rewards with spellbinding views over the loch and landscape, a typical, ravishingly beautiful scene you can have all to yourself. </p>
  <p>Trace the roads that hug the coastline further north still and you’ll reach your final stop; hole yourself away in a cosy pub and chat to the locals of Ullapool. The setting is sublime, surrounded by the Wester Ross crags on one side and the sea to the other. A spellbinding stop and a perfect end to this Highland adventure; though the A835 that links the village to Inverness and back to your starting point promises more irresistible driving....</p>
