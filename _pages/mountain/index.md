  <p>Start in the northern reaches of the Lakes. Lowther Castle is a great tone-setter for your motoring adventure. Why? Because you're in the heartland of the Romantics, and they loved nothing more than a folly. Built in the 19th century, its vast, Gothic-revival pomp is an impressive scene; all the more so with the knowledge that it had a room for every day of the year. Now, it sits ruinous, a dramatic sight set in pretty gardens. But onwards – the open road is calling!</p>
  <p>A winding, single-track road takes you to the B5320. Head south across Pooley Bridge and your first lakeside views begin to unravel. You're chasing the edge of Ullswater and heading for Aira Force – though the destination feels less important, as the gorgeous views that extend across the lake and fells are outstanding. You’ll reach Aira Force soon enough, a place where woodland glade tree-trails stretch high above the water. The walk is beautiful, but the real treat lies ahead. Aira Force is the Lake District’s most spectacular waterfall, tumbling down past lookout points and below a pretty stone bridge. Back near the lake’s shore, catch a glimpse of the Ullswater Steamer which glides along the length of the lake, in a landscape that proved one of Wordsworth’s most cherished.</p>

  <p>Head away from Ullswater and cross the peaks and fells on the A5091. It’s typical of the picturesque minor roads in the Lakes, climbing and winding and darting between farmsteads and valleys. Look out for the pretty Matterdale Church on your right. At the end, follow signs for Keswick.</p>
  <p>Keswick is located in a deep valley, near the shores of the Derwent Water and surrounded by billowing fells. It’s a small, charming town, a perfect base for wandering the local pikes and waters, with a short hike up to Castlerigg Stone Circle being particularly atmospheric. A good selection of homely pubs and restaurants offer respite, with a clutch of independent shops, weekly markets and quirky museums – like the pencil museum – adding to its unique delights. To the west, Whinlatter Forest Park – England’s only mountain Forest – is worth an excursion for its truly captivating woodland trails. Long walks under thick canopies are one thing, but Whinlatter is also home to the Go Ape treetop assault course and excellent mountain bike routes with bike hire available from Cyclewise.</p>

  <p>If you’ve got a taste for more adventure, take the Honister Pass to the Honister Slate Mine. The road is spectacular, turning to a single-track affair as the elevation climbs. It twists and dives, with mountains streams and tumbling falls on either side. As you reach the mine, prepare for the head-spinning Via Ferrata – the old trail the miners would use that scales the side of the cliff. Heritage trails take you deep inside the mines. As you leave, carry on up the road and take a right at Buttermere. The road back to Keswick makes for another beautiful drive.</p>
  <p>Head south from Keswick on the A591, often dubbed one of the most scenic roads in the Lakes. It gently winds its way around sloping hills, giving you the chance to slow the pace and take in the gorgeous views. As you pass Grasmere – and do stop to pick up some of their famous gingerbread – look out for Dove Cottage. The great Romantic, William Wordsworth, lived and wrote much of his work in this cottage. It now houses the greatest collection of his personal belongings, from poetry to paintings, that illuminate the life of this seminal English poet and his love affair with the Lake District. A copy of his verse is a perfect companion for the rest of your adventure.</p>

  <p>No motor-journey through the Lake District is complete without tackling the Wrynose &amp; Hardknott Passes. Infamous yet irresistibly rewarding, one follows the other in a perfect set of dizzying hairpins, stomach-turning heights, and brake-busting steeps. Impossible in winter and hair-raising in summer, the views are unmissable – don’t miss the Roman fort in the Hardknott lowland. If you’re craving more adventure, follow the road north around Wastwater, where Scafell Pike looms on the horizon. England’s highest mountain is a worthy climb that rewards adventurers with some of the best panorama in the Lakes. The hike is not for the faint hearted, with due care needed to account for weather and other difficulties – but a sensible head will be rewarded dutifully by this vast mountain.</p>
  <p>Whether you tackle the climb or not, turn the car around and try both the passes again from the other direction. After another nail-biting series of twists and turns, head south and bumble into Hawkshead. Whitewashed cottages and narrow cobbled lanes make for an intimate and characterful Lakeland village. A smattering of cafes and pubs offer respite from wild hikes in the local hills, in a setting that’s quintessentially Cumbrian. Don’t miss the coveted Hawkshead Brewery a short walk out of the village, with a modern tap room and live music on weekends. You can also visit Beatrix Potter’s House, now a charming museum to the renowned children’s author.</p>

  <p>Leave Hawkshead on the B5285, gliding between lake and hillside, until the vast expanse of Lake Windermere unravels on the horizon. Take the cable car-ferry across the water and stand in awe of the beauty of the place. It’s this kind of scene that so compelled the Romantics to keep returning to Cumbria. To make a start, head to Bowness-on-Windermere, the premier lakeside town. Its Victorian lakeside charms are perfect for recharging, before heading to the Windermere shores.</p>
  <p>Now you’ve reached peak Lakeland, it’s time to wind your way out of this spectacular landscape. Head south, following the lakeside road, for your final stop. Cartmel is irresistibly pretty. This tiny medieval village has a few big draws that belie its small size, most notably the towering early-12th-century priory that is its most recognisable landmark. Or is it the famous Cartmel racecourse? It’s neither. It’s pudding. Cartmel is the home of sticky toffee pudding, invented here by the Cartmel Village Shop which still is a mecca for all pudding aficionados. Before you head for dessert however, don’t miss Cumbria’s best-known restaurant, two-Michelin-star L’Enclume, a perfect conclusion to one epic road trip.</p>
