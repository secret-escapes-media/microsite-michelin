  <p>Begin in Bakewell, an irresistibly charming starting point where the smell of sweet Bakewell Puddings lingers across town. A Monday is a good start, when the weekly market rolls into town promising local produce – fill your boot for later, as the Peaks shelter some spellbinding picnic spots. Failing that, stock up on Bakewell Pudding – there are two bakeries that claim the original, each with their own secret ingredients and recipes spinning a sweet likeness to the Montague and Capulet rivalry. Leave for Haddon Hall, a fine example of a Tudor Manor with much older roots. As you leave, take the B6102, tracing the river Derwent – this road will be your first flavour of things to come, with sweeping corners and valley views unfolding in front of you. Just watch out for sheep; they’ll trundle onto the tarmac with a practised nonchalance. To your right is Chatsworth House, a grand estate that paints a picture of romantic sensibilities, a Jane Austen vision of Britain’s stately countryside communities. The grounds are vast and the house filled with remarkable artworks.</p>
  <p>Heading further north past Baslow and you’ll soon hit upon the historic village of Eyam, whose surroundings offer a choice of great walks. Eyam stands as a remarkable model of community self-sacrifice, where – during The Great Plague – the villagers agreed to quarantine themselves to stop the spread of plague. A number of sites across the village tell this harrowing story, woven into walks amongst the crags that surround it. Follow the road west out of Eyam.</p>

  <p>This is quintessential English country driving. Fields and valleys spill into the horizon left and right, as the road meanders through the dales. Bear right onto the B6049, where the lanes are lined with stacked stone farmer’s walls and the peaks rise to one side. And this isn’t even one of the Peak District’s famous drives; if anything, it reiterates the joy in exploring this area without much of a guide, stumbling on these lanes that wind on for miles and miles. Toward the end of the road the Hope Valley begins, one of the Peak’s finest beauty spots. For now, skip it and continue north for the Derwent Dam.</p>
  <p>The fells rise around you as the twin slivers of water shoulder the road. As you reach the towers of the Derwent Dam, hop out and look over the still expanse. With the hills in the backdrop, it’s a beautiful scene. One of the towers hosts a museum about the bouncing bomb tests conducted here during the Second World War, the groundwork for the famous Dambuster mission. </p>

<div class="width width--lg text--lg">
  <p>Leaving the dam in your rear-view mirror, make for Glossop; not because Glossop is particularly interesting, no. Because the road that takes you there, the forebodingly-named Snake Pass, is a masterpiece of twists, turns, and beguiling landscapes. It’s a reminder of how fun, and hair-raising, the British countryside can be on four wheels. As the road ends in Glossop, you can head south back to the Hope Valley. Or, turn your car around and have another stab at the Snake Pass, heading back that way. </p>
  <p>Make for Edale, around the eponymous road that winds through this spectacular peaks landscape. The small village is a great starting point for tackling the surrounding crags – in particular, Mam Tor. A hike to the top offers some of the best views in the Peaks and makes a perfect pit-stop for finishing your leftover Bakewell Pudding. The Winnats Pass is also nearby, a narrow, dizzying road where the surrounding peaks encircle the road. It’s dramatic, challenging, and the only way to get to Castleton. This area also hides a variety of beguiling cave networks, a noteworthy stop being Speedwell Cavern. Here, venture deep into the bowels of the network and take a small boat through choked, water-logged tunnels before the network opens to a vast, cathedral-like space. It’s an enchanting, rare experience.</p>

  <p>Push on to Castleton. The 11th-century stronghold of Peveril Castle looms over the village. It’s a great vantage point for views over the Hope Valley, a picture of Romanticism in this dramatic landscape. The village itself is an idyllic rest stop, with great pubs and charm by the bucket load. </p>
  <p>For a bit more cosmopolitan flair, head for Buxton, one of the largest towns in the Peaks. Here, Regency architecture sets a stylish tone; it extends to the smart shops, fine restaurants and bars. It’s also a famous spa town – and it has been a long drive. Check in and let yourself be pampered. If the driving itch is yet to be satisfied, the road west to Macclesfield is one of the most dangerous in the country. Known as the Cat &amp; Fiddle, its twists and turns are surprising, at times tight, accompanied by stomach-lurching drops with no real safety rail to speak of. It requires utmost attention and care; but the rewards are great.</p>
