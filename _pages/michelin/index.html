    title: The Check
    description: Your tyres are the only thing between you and the road so it’s important to make sure they are safe and in tip-top condition. Check the tread depths are within the legal limit of 1.6mm and top up the air pressures to the recommended level. Be aware that under-inflated tyres increase wear, diminish road holding and use more fuel. Michelin offers online tyre care tips, or you can always visit a local, reputable tyre dealer who will normally carry out a tyre check free of charge.

    title: The Michelin Guide
    description: The Michelin-starred restaurant rating is an iconic, international benchmark for gastronomy. However, not many people realise it was developed as part of a clever motorist handbook; Michelin maps and travel guides were a clever marketing idea introduced in the 1900s to encourage motorists to travel further afield and boost tyres sales.The publications have kept in tune with traveller’s needs and evolved through the digital revolution so they can still be accessed online today. Michelin’s online route planner ‘ViaMichelin’ can help you plan your road trip and will highlight tourist spots and hotel and restaurant recommendations from the Michelin Guide – including unmissable Michelin-starred restaurants.
