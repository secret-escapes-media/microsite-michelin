  <p>Your drive starts on the Dingle Peninsula. Tralee is the most vibrant town you’ll visit for a while, so throw yourself into the action before you embark on your road trip; the National Folk Theatre Siamsa Tire is worth checking out with performances that explore local folk tales, traditions and culture. As you leave the town, don’t miss the pretty Blennerville Windmill, which poignantly was the last view of Ireland for locals escaping the Great Famine.</p>
  <p>Follow the N86 out of town with views extending across the Atlantic. The road chases the coastline on the R560, leading you to Brandon Bay. Here, rural Ireland paints a picture-postcard perfect scene, with stone dwellings and weather-beaten heather highlands crafting a beautiful backdrop to your adventure. Stop and explore, or push on in the direction of one of Ireland’s highest peaks, Brandon Mountain. The road takes you over the mountain trail, the Connor Pass – Ireland’s highest pass. This nail-biting stretch is not for the faint of heart. The pass frequently turns into a single-track road with sheer drops to one side, an exhilarating run with views unmatched. The twists and turns are a little more forgiving, allowing you to soak up the views as you descend into Dingle.</p>

  <p>Further west lie the remote Blasket Islands, where female Irish writer Peig Sayers lived or a time. Her memoir is woven into the culture of Kerry. Back in Dingle, fresh shellfish are served up across town, with local tipples to try from the Dingle Distillery. Follow the coastal road east, past the gorgeous Inch Beach (obligatory paddle stop included) and turn in to the next peninsula, joining the Ring of Kerry.</p>
  <p>Killorglin is a wonderfully eccentric village that marks the beginning of the peninsula. Spot the goat statue – this is King Puck. Every year, a wild mountain goat is crowned king, followed by days of partying and merriment. Totally mad, brilliantly so, and also Ireland’s oldest festival. Follow the N70 west through quaint Irish pastures, weaving behind mountains and kissing the coastline. The beach at Rossbeigh is a favourite for horseback rides, but as you near the tip of the peninsula, the landscape becomes truly awe-inspiring. Stop at Portmagee and take the boat to Skellig Michael. This remote rock shelters a 6th century monastery, a heady climb to which rewards with incredible views. In a word, the place is utterly beguiling.</p>

  <p>Back on dry land, take the Skellig Ring as you follow this craggy coastline, past forgotten castles and ancient stone forts. Kenmare makes for a pleasant stop. This little fishing town is lined with craft shops and excellent restaurants, with plenty of locally-caught seafood on offer. Once you’ve had your fill, head across to the Beara Peninsula and chase the coast once more. Wave goodbye to County Kerry as you fly down country lanes into County Cork. After a picturesque drive, reach the end of the peninsula for moving Atlantic views.</p>
  <p>Dursey Island awaits. The only way to cross the Atlantic and reach the island is by cable car; which, naturally, Dursey Islanders (of which there are but a handful) get to skip the queue for. Once across, beautiful coastal walking trails take you across the small island. Make sure you stock up before you head across though, as there’s not a shop nor a pub on this remote rock.</p>

<div class="width width--lg text--lg">
  <p>On to Sheep’s Head. It’s the smallest and least travelled of the peninsulas, but it packs rural charm in abundance. The driving is wonderfully typical for the area, darting between wild valleys and craggy cliffs. Dip in and out of small villages and explore an untamed landscape before heading to the final finger of the Southern Peninsulas. If you time it right, don’t miss the storytelling festival on Cape Clear Island, for an esoteric taste of local culture.</p>
  <p>Mizen Head is your final stop. Perched on the end of the peninsula, it’s Ireland’s most south-westerly point, a turbulent wilderness where the rowdy Atlantic crashes against fierce looking cliffs. Your car will only get you so far here; you’ll have to go the rest of the way on foot. Follow that path down to the cliffs, navigating the famous 99 steps on some of the most dramatic clifftop trails in the country. Cross the arched bridge, with the waves crashing underneath you, to reach the old signal station. The views are soul-stirring. The effect is best described as feeling like you've reached the edge of Ireland. It’s a fitting end, a final capitulation to the raw and untamed beauty of the Southern Peninsulas.</p>
